# Supabase User Sync Solution

## Problem
Users were being created in Supabase Auth (`auth.users` table) but not appearing in the public database (`public.users` table). This caused issues where:
- Authentication worked correctly
- Users could log in and use the app
- But no user records were visible in the database tables
- Other tables that reference users couldn't find the user records

## Root Cause
The authentication flow was only saving user data to the local SQLite database and not syncing it to the Supabase public database. The app had two separate user storage systems:
1. **Supabase Auth** - Handles authentication (OTP, sessions, etc.)
2. **Public Database** - Stores user profiles and app data
3. **Local SQLite** - Offline storage and caching

## Solution

### 1. Application-Level Sync (Implemented)
Modified `lib/features/authentication/data/datasources/auth_supabase_datasource.dart` to automatically sync users to the public database after successful authentication.

**Key Changes:**
- Added `_syncUserToDatabase()` method
- Called sync after successful OTP verification
- Handles both new user creation and existing user updates
- Graceful error handling (doesn't break auth flow if sync fails)

### 2. Database-Level Triggers (Recommended)
Created `supabase_user_sync_trigger.sql` with database triggers that automatically sync users from `auth.users` to `public.users`.

**Benefits:**
- Automatic sync at the database level
- No application code changes needed
- Handles all user operations (create, update, delete)
- More reliable than application-level sync

### 3. Manual Sync for Existing Users
Created `sync_existing_users.sql` to sync all existing users from `auth.users` to `public.users`.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Run Database Triggers (Recommended)
1. Open your Supabase dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Run the contents of `supabase_user_sync_trigger.sql`
4. This will create triggers that automatically sync users

### Step 2: Sync Existing Users
1. In Supabase SQL Editor, run the contents of `sync_existing_users.sql`
2. This will sync all existing users from `auth.users` to `public.users`
3. Verify the sync worked by checking both tables

### Step 3: Test the Solution
1. Create a new user through the app
2. Check that the user appears in both `auth.users` and `public.users`
3. Verify that other tables can now reference the user

## Files Modified

### Application Code
- `lib/features/authentication/data/datasources/auth_supabase_datasource.dart`
  - Added `_syncUserToDatabase()` method
  - Modified `verifyOTP()` to call sync after successful authentication

### Database Scripts
- `supabase_user_sync_trigger.sql` - Database triggers for automatic sync
- `sync_existing_users.sql` - Manual sync for existing users

## Verification

After implementing the solution, you should see:

1. **New users** automatically appear in `public.users` table
2. **Existing users** synced from `auth.users` to `public.users`
3. **Other tables** can now reference users properly
4. **Local storage** continues to work for offline functionality

## Testing

To test the solution:

1. **Create a new user:**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.users;
   -- Note the count, then create a new user in the app
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.users;
   -- Count should increase by 1
   ```

2. **Check user data:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM public.users ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
   ```

3. **Verify relationships:**
   ```sql
   SELECT u.id, u.phone_number, t.first_name, t.last_name
   FROM public.users u
   LEFT JOIN public.teachers t ON t.user_id = u.id;
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### If users still don't appear:
1. Check if triggers are installed: `SELECT * FROM information_schema.triggers WHERE trigger_name LIKE '%auth_user%';`
2. Check for errors in Supabase logs
3. Verify RLS policies allow inserts to `public.users`
4. Test manual insert to ensure permissions are correct

### If sync fails:
1. Check Supabase logs for error messages
2. Verify the user has proper permissions
3. Ensure the `public.users` table exists and has correct schema
4. Check if RLS policies are blocking the operation

## Security Considerations

- The triggers use `SECURITY DEFINER` to run with elevated privileges
- RLS policies should be configured to allow the sync operations
- The application-level sync includes error handling to prevent auth failures
- Both approaches are designed to be fail-safe (auth works even if sync fails)

## Future Improvements

1. **Monitoring**: Add logging to track sync success/failure rates
2. **Retry Logic**: Implement retry mechanism for failed syncs
3. **Batch Sync**: For large user bases, implement batch sync operations
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Handle cases where user data conflicts between auth and public tables
