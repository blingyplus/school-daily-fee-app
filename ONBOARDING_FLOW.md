  // Check if user has first_name and last_name
}

Future<String?> getUserSchool(String userId) {
  // Check if user has associated school
}

// Route logic:
if (hasCompletedProfile && hasSchool) {
  → Dashboard
} else if (hasCompletedProfile && !hasSchool) {
  → Role Selection
} else {

}
```
